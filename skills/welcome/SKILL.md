Welcome to **Rising Tides**! You now have access to 79 skills that make Claude Code dramatically more capable.

### Quick Start

**Try these commands:**

1. **Get personalized recommendations:**
   ```
   /recommend skills
   ```
   Claude analyzes your project and suggests relevant skills.

2. **Try a skill directly:**
   ```
   /copywriting write a tagline for my app
   /react-dev create a login component
   /commit-work review my changes
   ```

3. **See what's available:**
   - Marketing & SEO: copywriting, seo-audit, marketing-psychology
   - Frontend: react-dev, frontend-design, web-design-guidelines
   - Backend: supabase-guide, firebase-guide, drizzle-orm

   - And 60+ more!

### How It Works

Your Project → /recommend skills → Matches to your needs → Skills load on-demand
