# Git Workflow

End-to-end git and GitHub workflow using `gh` CLI and GitHub MCP.

## MCP Setup (First Run)

Before starting work, check if GitHub MCP tools are available:

1. Use ToolSearch to look for `github` tools
2. If tools are found → proceed directly to the user's task
3. If tools are NOT found → set up the MCP:

   a. Run: `claude mcp add github -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-github`
      (This adds the MCP to the current project, not globally)
   b. Tell the user: "GitHub MCP has been added to this project.
      Please restart Claude to activate it (type 'exit', then run 'claude')."
   c. Give the user a **resume prompt** they can paste after restarting:
      "After restarting, paste this to continue where you left off:"
      Then generate a prompt that summarizes what the user was asking for, e.g.:
      `I was working on [user's task]. GitHub MCP should now be active. Please continue.`
   d. STOP — do not continue until user restarts and MCP is available

   If the user prefers to do it themselves, give them:
   - Command: `claude mcp add github -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-github`
   - Or: they can add it to `.mcp.json` manually

IMPORTANT: Never use `-s user` or `--scope user`. Project scope is the default
and keeps MCPs contained to where they're needed.

**Note:** The `gh` CLI still works without the MCP. The MCP adds richer API operations.

## Prerequisites

**Install GitHub CLI:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Windows
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh
```

**Authenticate:**
```bash
gh auth login
gh auth status  # verify
```

## Commit Workflow

Make commits that are easy to review and safe to ship.

### Inputs to ask for (if missing)
- Single or multiple commits? Default to multiple when changes are unrelated.
- Any rules: max subject length, required scopes.

### Steps

1. **Inspect the working tree**
   - `git status` and `git diff` (unstaged)
   - For many changes: `git diff --stat`

2. **Decide commit boundaries** (split if needed)
   - Split by: feature vs refactor, backend vs frontend, formatting vs logic, tests vs prod code, dependency bumps vs behavior changes.

3. **Stage only what belongs in the next commit**
   - Prefer `git add -p` for mixed changes in one file.
   - Unstage mistakes: `git restore --staged -p` or `git restore --staged <path>`

4. **Review what will be committed**
   - `git diff --cached`
   - Check for: secrets/tokens, debug logging, unrelated formatting churn.

5. **Describe the staged change in 1-2 sentences**
   - "What changed?" + "Why?"
   - If you cannot describe it cleanly, the commit is too big or mixed -- go back to step 2.

6. **Write the commit message** (Conventional Commits required)
   ```
   type(scope): short summary

   Body: what changed and why (not implementation diary).
   Footer: BREAKING CHANGE if needed.
   ```
   Use `git commit -v` for multi-line messages.

7. **Run the smallest relevant verification**
   - Unit tests, lint, or build before moving on.

8. **Repeat** until the working tree is clean.

## GitHub Workflows

### New Repository
```bash
gh repo create my-project --public --add-readme
# Or from existing local folder
cd my-project && git init
gh repo create --source=. --public --push
```

### Feature PR
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# commit using workflow above
git push -u origin feature/my-feature
gh pr create --title "feat: add feature" --body "Description"
```

### Releases
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
gh release create v1.0.0 --generate-notes
```

### Issue Management
```bash
gh issue create --title "Bug: description" --label "bug" --body "Details..."
gh issue edit 123 --add-assignee @me
gh issue close 123
```

### GitHub Actions
```bash
gh workflow list
gh run list
gh workflow run deploy.yml
gh run view [run-id]
gh run watch [run-id]
```

## Deliverable

After committing, provide:
- The final commit message(s)
- A short summary per commit (what/why)
- Commands used to stage/review

## When to Use

- Committing work with clean, logical commits
- Creating PRs for code review
- Starting a new project / creating a GitHub repo
- Releasing a new version with tags
- Managing issues and project tracking
- Checking CI/CD status
