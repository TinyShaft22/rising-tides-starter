# Database Pro

Design production-ready schemas and optimize database performance.

## MCP Setup (First Run)

Before starting work, check if Postgres tools are available:

1. Use ToolSearch to look for `postgres` tools
2. If tools are found → proceed directly to the user's task
3. If tools are NOT found → set up the MCP:

   a. Run: `claude mcp add postgres -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-postgres`
      (This adds the MCP to the current project, not globally)
   b. Tell the user: "Postgres MCP has been added to this project.
      Please restart Claude to activate it (type 'exit', then run 'claude')."
   c. STOP — do not continue until user restarts and MCP is available

   If the user prefers to do it themselves, give them:
   - Command: `claude mcp add postgres -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/mcp-server-postgres`
   - Or: they can add it to `.mcp.json` manually

IMPORTANT: Never use `-s user` or `--scope user`. Project scope is the default
and keeps MCPs contained to where they're needed.

**Note:** This skill works without the MCP for schema design and query optimization advice. The MCP adds direct database connectivity.

## Quick Start

Describe your data model or performance problem:

```
design a schema for an e-commerce platform with users, products, orders
```

```
this query is slow, help me optimize it
```

**What to include:**
- Entities and relationships (users have orders, orders have items)
- Scale hints (high-traffic, millions of records)
- Database preference (PostgreSQL/MySQL/NoSQL) - defaults to PostgreSQL
- For optimization: the slow query and EXPLAIN output

---

## Triggers

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `design schema` | "design a schema for user authentication" |
| `database design` | "database design for multi-tenant SaaS" |
| `create tables` | "create tables for a blog system" |
| `slow query` | "this query takes 5 seconds, help me fix it" |
| `optimize query` | "optimize this SELECT with JOINs" |
| `execution plan` | "explain this EXPLAIN ANALYZE output" |
| `add indexes` | "what indexes should I add for this table" |
| `database performance` | "my database is slow under load" |

---

## Quick Reference

| Task | Approach | Key Consideration |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| New schema | Normalize to 3NF first | Model domain, not UI |
| SQL vs NoSQL | Access patterns decide | Read/write ratio matters |
| Primary keys | INT or UUID | UUID for distributed systems |
| Foreign keys | Always constrain | ON DELETE strategy critical |
| Indexes | FKs + WHERE + ORDER BY columns | Column order matters in composites |
| Slow queries | EXPLAIN ANALYZE first | Measure before and after |
| Migrations | Always reversible | Backward compatible first |

| * For optimization: run EXPLAIN ANALYZE              |
| * Establish baseline metrics                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |
    v
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Phase 2: DESIGN / DIAGNOSE                           |
| * Schema: Normalize to 3NF, define keys/constraints  |
| * Optimization: Identify missing indexes, bad joins  |
| * Choose appropriate data types                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |
    v
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Phase 3: OPTIMIZE                                    |
| * Plan indexing strategy                             |
| * Rewrite inefficient queries                        |

+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |
    v
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Phase 4: IMPLEMENT & VALIDATE                        |
| * Generate migration scripts (up + down)             |

## Core Principles

| Principle | Why | Implementation |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| Model the Domain | UI changes, domain doesn't | Entity names reflect business concepts |
| Data Integrity First | Corruption is costly | Constraints at database level |
| Measure Before Optimizing | Intuition misleads | EXPLAIN ANALYZE before any change |
| Optimize for Access Pattern | Can't optimize for both | OLTP: normalized, OLAP: denormalized |
| One Change at a Time | Isolate impact | Apply and measure incrementally |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| VARCHAR(255) everywhere | Wastes storage, hides intent | Size appropriately per field |
| FLOAT for money | Rounding errors | DECIMAL(10,2) |
| Missing FK constraints | Orphaned data | Always define foreign keys |
| No indexes on FKs | Slow JOINs | Index every foreign key |
| Optimizing without EXPLAIN | Guessing wastes time | Always read the execution plan |
| Over-indexing | Slow writes, wasted space | Only index what's actually queried |
| SELECT * | Fetches unnecessary data | Explicit column lists |
| Non-reversible migrations | Can't rollback | Always write DOWN migration |
| Multiple simultaneous changes | Can't isolate impact | One optimization at a time |
| Ignoring VACUUM/ANALYZE | Stale statistics, bloat | Schedule regular maintenance |

---

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Analyze EXPLAIN plans before optimizing
- Measure performance before and after changes
- Test changes in non-production first
- Document optimization decisions
- Monitor write performance impact after index changes
- Consider replication lag for distributed systems

### MUST NOT DO
- Apply optimizations without measurement
- Create redundant or unused indexes
- Make multiple changes simultaneously
- Optimize without understanding query patterns
- Skip execution plan analysis

---

## Verification Checklist

After designing or optimizing a schema:

- [ ] Every table has a primary key
- [ ] All relationships have foreign key constraints with ON DELETE strategy
- [ ] Indexes exist on all foreign keys
- [ ] Indexes exist on frequently queried WHERE/ORDER BY columns
- [ ] Appropriate data types (DECIMAL for money, TIMESTAMP for dates)
- [ ] NOT NULL on required fields, UNIQUE where needed
- [ ] CHECK constraints for validation
- [ ] created_at and updated_at timestamps
- [ ] Migration scripts are reversible
- [ ] EXPLAIN ANALYZE confirms index usage on critical queries
- [ ] No full table scans on large tables

<summary><strong>Deep Dive: Normalization (SQL)</strong></summary>

### Normal Forms

| Form | Rule | Violation Example |
|------|------|-------------------|
| **1NF** | Atomic values, no repeating groups | `product_ids = '1,2,3'` |
| **2NF** | 1NF + no partial dependencies | customer_name in order_items |
| **3NF** | 2NF + no transitive dependencies | country derived from postal_code |

### 1NF

```sql
-- BAD: Multiple values in column
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_ids VARCHAR(255)  -- '101,102,103'
);

-- GOOD: Separate table
CREATE TABLE order_items (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT REFERENCES orders(id),
  product_id INT
);
```

### 2NF

```sql
-- BAD: customer_name depends only on customer_id
CREATE TABLE order_items (
  order_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  customer_name VARCHAR(100),  -- Partial dependency!
  PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)
);

-- GOOD: Customer data in separate table
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### When to Denormalize

| Scenario | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| Read-heavy reporting | Pre-calculated aggregates |
| Expensive JOINs | Cached derived columns |
| Analytics dashboards | Materialized views |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Deep Dive: Indexing & Query Optimization</strong></summary>

### When to Create Indexes

| Always Index | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| Foreign keys | Speed up JOINs |
| WHERE clause columns | Speed up filtering |
| ORDER BY columns | Speed up sorting |
| Unique constraints | Enforced uniqueness |

### Index Types

| Type | Best For | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| B-Tree | Ranges, equality | `price > 100` |
| Hash | Exact matches only | `email = 'x@y.com'` |
| GIN | Arrays, JSONB, full-text | `tags @> '{urgent}'` |
| Partial | Subset of rows | `WHERE is_active = true` |

### Composite Index Order

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_status ON orders(customer_id, status);

-- Uses index (leftmost prefix)
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123;
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123 AND status = 'pending';

-- Does NOT use index (no leftmost column)
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending';
```

**Rule:** Most selective column first, or column most queried alone.

### Reading EXPLAIN ANALYZE

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 123 AND status = 'pending';
```

| Look For | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Seq Scan | Full table scan | Add index |
| Index Scan | Index used | Good |
| Nested Loop (high rows) | N+1 pattern | Rewrite as JOIN |
| Sort (on disk) | Insufficient work_mem | Add index or increase work_mem |
| Hash Join (large) | Big hash table | Check join selectivity |
| rows=estimated vs actual | Stale statistics | Run ANALYZE |

### N+1 Query Problem

```sql
-- BAD: N+1 queries
SELECT * FROM orders;
-- then for each order:
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = ?;

-- GOOD: Single JOIN
SELECT orders.*, customers.name
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id;
```

### Optimization Techniques

| Technique | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| Add indexes | Slow WHERE/ORDER BY/JOIN |
| Covering indexes | Avoid table lookups |
| Denormalize | Expensive repeated JOINs |
| Pagination (keyset) | Large result sets |
| Partitioning | Very large tables (100M+ rows) |
| Read replicas | Read-heavy load |
| Connection pooling | Many short-lived connections |

<summary><strong>Deep Dive: Data Types & Constraints</strong></summary>

### Numeric Types

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| INT / BIGINT | IDs, counts |
| DECIMAL(p,s) | Money (exact) |
| FLOAT/DOUBLE | Scientific data (approximate) |

```sql
-- ALWAYS use DECIMAL for money
price DECIMAL(10, 2)  -- up to $99,999,999.99
```

### Date/Time

```sql
-- Always store in UTC
created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
```

### Foreign Keys

```sql
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
  ON DELETE CASCADE     -- Delete children with parent
  ON DELETE RESTRICT    -- Prevent if referenced
  ON DELETE SET NULL    -- Nullify on parent delete
```

| Strategy | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| CASCADE | Dependent data (order_items) |
| RESTRICT | Important references (prevent accidents) |
| SET NULL | Optional relationships |

### Primary Keys

```sql
-- Auto-increment
id BIGINT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY

-- UUID (distributed systems)
id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()

-- Composite (junction tables)
PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
```

### Check Constraints

```sql
price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (price >= 0)
discount INT CHECK (discount BETWEEN 0 AND 100)
email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Deep Dive: Relationship Patterns</strong></summary>

### One-to-Many

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_items (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  product_id INT NOT NULL,
  quantity INT NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0)
);
```

### Many-to-Many

```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
  student_id INT REFERENCES students(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  course_id INT REFERENCES courses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  enrolled_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```

### Self-Referencing

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  manager_id INT REFERENCES employees(id)
);
```

### Polymorphic

```sql
-- Separate FKs (stronger integrity)
CREATE TABLE comments (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  post_id INT REFERENCES posts(id),
  photo_id INT REFERENCES photos(id),
  CHECK (
    (post_id IS NOT NULL AND photo_id IS NULL) OR
    (post_id IS NULL AND photo_id IS NOT NULL)
  )
);
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Deep Dive: Migrations</strong></summary>

### Adding a Column (Zero-Downtime)

```sql
-- Step 1: Add nullable column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);

-- Step 2: Deploy code that writes to new column
-- Step 3: Backfill existing rows
UPDATE users SET phone = '' WHERE phone IS NULL;

-- Step 4: Make required (if needed)
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN phone SET NOT NULL;
```

### Renaming a Column (Zero-Downtime)

```sql
-- Step 1: Add new column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_address VARCHAR(255);

-- Step 2: Copy data
UPDATE users SET email_address = email;

-- Step 3: Deploy code reading/writing new column
-- Step 4: Drop old column
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN email;
```

### Migration Template

```sql
-- Migration: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql

-- UP
BEGIN;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_phone ON users(phone);
COMMIT;

-- DOWN
BEGIN;
DROP INDEX idx_users_phone;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN phone;
COMMIT;
```

### Embedding vs Referencing

| Factor | Embed | Reference |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Access pattern | Read together | Read separately |
| Relationship | 1:few | 1:many |
| Document size | Small | Approaching 16MB |
| Update frequency | Rarely | Frequently |

### Embedded Document

```json
{
  "_id": "order_123",
  "customer": {
    "id": "cust_456",
    "name": "Jane Smith"
  },
  "items": [
    { "product_id": "prod_789", "quantity": 2, "price": 29.99 }
  ],
  "total": 109.97
}
```

### Referenced Document

```json
{
  "_id": "order_123",
  "customer_id": "cust_456",
  "item_ids": ["item_1", "item_2"],
  "total": 109.97
}
```

## PostgreSQL MCP

When `postgres` MCP is available, use it for:
- Running EXPLAIN ANALYZE on live queries
- Checking pg_stat_statements for slow query patterns
- Inspecting index usage with pg_stat_user_indexes
- Running schema migrations
- Checking table bloat and VACUUM status
