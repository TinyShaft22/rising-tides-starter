## What You're Getting

The Rising Tides system uses **progressive disclosure** — you don't load all skills into context. Claude discovers what's available through a lightweight index and loads full skill content only when needed.

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Project["Your Project"]
        direction TB
        Work["You're here building"]
        LocalSkills[".claude/skills/"]
        MCP[".mcp.json"]
    end

    subgraph Bridge["Discovery Layer"]
        Recommend["/recommend skills"]
        Index["SKILLS_INDEX.json<br/>Lightweight catalog"]
    end

    subgraph Global["~/.claude/ (Global Library)"]
        Skills["skills/<br/>170 folders"]
        Plugins["plugins/<br/>37 bundles"]
        Registry["MCP_REGISTRY.md"]
    end

    Work --> |"What skills help?"| Recommend
    Recommend --> |"Queries"| Index
    Index --> |"References"| Skills
    Skills --> |"Selected skills"| LocalSkills
    Plugins --> |"MCP config"| MCP

    style Project fill:#e1f5fe
    style Bridge fill:#fff3e0
    style Global fill:#e8f5e9
```

**You stay at project level.** You reach UP to the global library when needed, pull DOWN what helps.

### Progressive Disclosure (Context Efficiency)

| What | Tokens | When Loaded |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Skill descriptions | ~100 per skill | Session start |
| Full SKILL.md content | 500-2000 per skill | On invoke only |
| MCP tool schemas | ~500 per tool | On-demand (with Tool Search) |

**You're paying ~6% context for all 170 skills.** Full content loads only when you actually invoke a skill.

---

## One-Command Setup

### Mac

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SunsetSystemsAI/rising-tides-starter/main/scripts/setup-mac.sh -o /tmp/setup.sh && bash /tmp/setup.sh
```

> **Do NOT use `sudo`.** The script will ask for your password when needed.

### Windows

Open PowerShell **as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SunsetSystemsAI/rising-tides-starter/main/scripts/setup-windows.ps1' -OutFile "$env:TEMP\setup-windows.ps1"
& "$env:TEMP\setup-windows.ps1"
```

### Linux / WSL2

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SunsetSystemsAI/rising-tides-starter/main/scripts/setup-linux.sh -o /tmp/setup.sh && bash /tmp/setup.sh
```

---

## After Setup

The only manual step is authentication:

```bash
claude auth login
```

Then you're ready:

```bash
claude
```

### Get Skill Recommendations

In any project, run:

```
/recommend skills
```

Claude analyzes your project and shows which skills to import (and which to skip).

### Or Try Skills Directly

```
/copywriting write a headline for my productivity app
/react-dev create a login form component
/security-audit check this codebase for vulnerabilities
```

---

## Security Audit

<div align="center">

### Security Status: PASSED

</div>

We take security seriously. Every skill and script in this collection has been audited.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Audit["Security Audit Process"]
        direction TB
        A["1,012+ Files Scanned"]
        B["Pattern Analysis"]

        D["Fix & Verify"]
    end

    subgraph Results["Audit Results"]

        High["High: 0<br/>(2 fixed)"]
        Medium["Medium: 3<br/>(documented)"]
        Low["Low: 4<br/>(informational)"]
    end

    A --> B --> C --> D --> Results

    style High fill:#4caf50,color:#fff
    style Medium fill:#ff9800,color:#fff
    style Low fill:#2196f3,color:#fff
```

### What We Scanned

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Skill directories | 170 | ✅ Passed |
| Plugin directories | 37 | ✅ Passed |
| Shell scripts | 4 | ✅ Fixed |
| Python scripts | 76 | ✅ Reviewed |
| MCP configurations | 14 | ✅ Verified |
| **Total files** | **1,012+** | **✅ Audited** |

### Security Checks Performed

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Hardcoded API keys | ✅ None found |
| Malicious URLs | ✅ All official sources only |
| Data exfiltration code | ✅ None found |
| Command injection patterns | ✅ Fixed (2 instances) |
| Privilege escalation | ✅ Only in install docs |
| Unsafe file operations | ✅ None found |
| MCP over-permissions | ✅ Minimal permissions used |

### Community Repository Audit

We also audited 16 community repositories before including any skills:

| Verdict | Count | Outcome |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Approved** | 10 repos | Included in collection |
| **Rejected** | 6 repos | Not included |

**Rejection reasons included:** telemetry uploading user data, unauditable binaries, `bypassPermissions` flags, and unsafe curl-to-bash patterns.

### Security Model

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Safe["LOW RISK — Human Readable"]
        Skills["Skills<br/>SKILL.md files"]
        Docs["Documentation<br/>*.md files"]
        Index["Index files<br/>JSON catalogs"]
    end

    subgraph Trust["HIGHER RISK — Executable"]
        MCP["MCP Servers<br/>Run as processes"]
        NPX["npx packages<br/>Downloaded at runtime"]
    end

    Skills --> |"Auditable"| Review["You can read<br/>every line"]
    MCP --> |"Verified"| Approved["Only approved<br/>MCPs listed"]

    style Safe fill:#c8e6c9
    style Trust fill:#fff3e0
```

**Skills are safe by design** — they're just markdown files you can read and audit yourself.

**MCPs require trust** — we only include MCPs from verified publishers (Anthropic, Upstash, Microsoft).

```

---

## MCP Configuration

MCPs are configured **per-project** to minimize context overhead.

**Only Memory MCP should be global** — it stores persistent knowledge across all projects.

### Setting Up Memory MCP

```bash
claude mcp add memory --scope user
```

### Project-Level MCPs

When you run `/recommend skills` and confirm plugin imports, MCPs are configured automatically.

Or configure manually:

```bash
claude mcp add context7 --scope project
claude mcp add playwright --scope project
```

---

## Verification

After setup, verify your installation:

```bash
# Check versions
node --version       # Should be 18+
claude --version     # Should return version

# Check skills installed
ls ~/.claude/skills | wc -l  # Should be 170+

# Check index file
cat ~/.claude/SKILLS_INDEX.json | head

# Check Tool Search enabled
echo $ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH  # Should be "true"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Script fails or stops partway on Mac

Clean up and retry:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SunsetSystemsAI/rising-tides-starter/main/scripts/cleanup-mac.sh -o /tmp/cleanup.sh && bash /tmp/cleanup.sh
```

### "command not found: claude" after install

Close and reopen your terminal, then try again.

### Skills not loading

```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills | wc -l  # Should be 170+
cat ~/.claude/SKILLS_INDEX.json | head
```

### MCPs not working

```bash
claude mcp list
export ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true
```

---

## Optional: Anthropic Enterprise Plugins

After setup, you can also install Anthropic's enterprise knowledge-work plugins:

```bash
claude plugins add knowledge-work-plugins/productivity
claude plugins add knowledge-work-plugins/sales
claude plugins add knowledge-work-plugins/data
```

These cover sales, legal, finance, and product management — complementing Rising Tides' developer-focused skills.
